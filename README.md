# Installing Cloud Pak for Integration
The IBM Cloud Pak for Integration (CP4I) is delivered as operators that are installed and managed using the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) within Red Hat OpenShift. To install CP4I, we will verify that the OLM Catalog Sources for IBM components are added, we will then install the operators using OLM, create the CP4I custom resource, and finally deploy some of the capabilities and runtimes.
